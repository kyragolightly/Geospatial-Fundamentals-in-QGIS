# D-Lab GIS Fundamentals with QGIS workshop series 

This is the repository for D-Lab's introductory R-Fundamentals workshop series. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Workshop Goals

This workshop will introduce methods for working with geospatial data in QGIS, a popular open-source desktop GIS program that runs on both PCs and Macs as well as linux computers. Participants will learn how to load, query and visualize point, line and polygon data. We will also introduce basic methods for processing spatial data, which are the building blocks of spatial analysis workflows. Coordinate reference systems and map projections will also be introduced.

# Installation Instructions

In preparation for the upcoming workshop you will need to install QGIS and the workshop materials.

### 1) Install QGIS
QGIS is free and open source and installation is detailed on the [main website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).

The following installations are general guidelines and may change in the future depending on the developers.

**Windows:**

1. You have the option to either install the standalone version of QGIS or install it in OSGeo4W.

* For new users, the **standalone version** is recommended.

2. If you’re using the standalone version:

* Go to the [download page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and either download the 32bit or 64bit version of QGIS.

* Select the Long Term Stable Release!

3. If you’re using the OSGeo4W version:

* Go to the [download page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and either download the 32bit or 64bit version of OSGeor4W installer.

* Select *Desktop Express Install* and install the latest version of QGIS.
> If you want the long term release, select *Advanced Install* and select *qgis-ltr-full* or *qgis-ltr*. 
> There’s also an option to install the development version.

**Mac:**

1. Go to the [download page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and download the latest version of QGIS.
  a. Note that this is for macOS Sierra or later (10.13).
  b. If you are using 10.15 or later QGIS may not be notarized yet. The first time you open the application you’ll need to right click on the icon, hold the option key, and manually pick *Open*.

### 2) Download the workshop materials
Download the workshop materials by visiting the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-QGIS).To run these lessons on your laptop: 

* Click the green "Clone or Download" button
* Click "Download Zip"
* Extract this file someplace familiar (we recommend Desktop) 

> If you are a Git user, simply clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing: `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-QGIS.git`

# Is RStudio not working on your laptop? 

Attend the workshop anyway, we can provide you with a cloud-based solution (DataHub or Binder) until you figure out the problems with your local installation. 

You can also run these lessons on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2Fpython-fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2Fpython-fundamentals%2F). By using this link, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the GIS-fundamentals-with-QGIS folder. CalNet ID credentials required.
If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud by clicking this [Binder button](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals/master). By using this button, you cannot save your work.
